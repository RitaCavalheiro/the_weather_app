# Ducky Duck Weather App

* Technologies used: HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript, Openweather API
* A real-time weather web app built from scratch
* The connection to the Openweather API allows for the app to show the current weather at your current location and to search for the forecast for the next 6 days of any city in the world
* To create a more interesting interface, I designed Ducky Duck in various weather conditions, you can see the colors and the character's mood change according to the weather conditions
